o New feature: Output MS/MS matching spectra between seed and neighbor.
o New feature: In MetDNA: If ms2.match.annotation.result.csv exist, set ms2.annotation as FALSE. If MRN.annotation.result.csv exist, set mrn.annotation as FALSE.

Version 0.99.10
--------------
o Fix bug in ms2Annotation: Change the default molecular descriptors for RT prediction in RP model.
o Close the dysregulated pathway analysis in metPathway.

o Fix a bug in groupRT function.
o Fix a bug in metModule function.

Version 0.99.11
--------------
o New feature: Use the annotations of dysregulated for pathway enrichment analysis. The users can also provide the markers which you select by your methods. The markers file should be named as "marker.csv" and placed in "POS" or "NEG" folder. The marker only contain two columns, first column is "peak.name" and second column is "KEGG.ID", and if one peak matches multiple annotations, the KEGG IDs should be seperated using semicolon ";".
o Dysregulated network is set FALSE by default.
o Pathway enrichment analysis is set TRUE by default if polarity is "both", and FALSE if polarity is "positive" or "negative".
o New feature: You can give remain.idx in the directory.
o Fix a fetal bug in readAnnotation.
o Fix a bug when msp data is from MetAnalyzer (20171029).
o Fix a bug in pathway quantitative analysis (20171107).
o New feature: metabolite quantitative, use all identification result; pathway quantitative, use the dysregulated metabolite.

Version 0.99.12
--------------
o New feature: User can use MetDNA function to process positive and negative in one run.
o New feature: The run log is outputed as txt.
o Fix a bug in uniTest.
o Fix a bug in isotopeAnnotation when peak intensity is 0.
o New feature: Add two new arguments. 1. ms2.match.plot, default is TRUE, output MS/MS spectral match plot or not in MS2 match identification. 2. seed.neighbor.match.plot, default is FALSE, output MS/MS spectral match plot between seed and neighbor or not.
o Fix a bug when the sample name starts with a number.
o Fix a bug when the users change the data.csv to do pathway enrichment analysis.
o Fix a bug in analysisReport.
o New feature: The parameters can be direct from MetDNA.paramters.csv using the new argument: parameter (20171220).

Version 0.99.13
--------------
o A new argument, instrument is added. It can be set as AgilentQTOF, SciexTripleTOF, other QTOF and ThermoOrbitrap.

Version 0.99.14
--------------
o Fix a bug when there are only one sample in one group.

Version 0.99.15
--------------
o Fix a bug in analysisGeneration.

Version 0.99.16
--------------
o Add P-values to Quantitative.pathway.metabolite.result.csv.
o Re-orginize the analysis results.
o Remove the MS2_match_results.

Version 1.0.0
--------------

Version 1.0.1
--------------
o Fix a bugs: When number of dysregulated peaks is less than 10, give a warning.

Version 1.0.2
--------------
